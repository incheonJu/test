								<span class="txt">Compression</span>
							</a>
						</dt>
						<dd class="answer">A piece of uncured rubber of the correct size is placed between two halves of a heated mould. The mould is closed in a press under a pressure of around one ton/sq in and the rubber is forced into the exact shape of the cavity. The rubber gains heat by conduction from the mould surfaces and "cures". When the rubber has had sufficient time to cure, the mould can be opened and the part removed. Compression moulding is a relatively simple process and is often used for components required in fairly low quantities. It is also the most economic method for parts with simple shapes. Parts moulded by this method will always have some flash because the mould surfaces are held apart by the necessary excess rubber in the "blank".</dd>

								<span class="txt">Direct Injection</span>
							</a>
						</dt>
						<dd class="answer">A screw injection system delivers a metered quantity of rubber into the closed mould. The injection unit is fed from a continuous strip or a reservoir of uncured rubber and is cooled to avoid premature curing. This process is generally used for multi-cavity moulds and can produce hundreds of components per press cycle. Because of the amount of rubber in the system, it is inadvisable to change materials frequently Large moulds require complex feed systems to balance the pressures in each cavity. Generally these are in the heated top half of the mould and cure at the same time as the components. Unlike thermoplastics, cured thermoset rubber cannot be reground or reused and the additional waste has to be included in the material usage per piece. Where very large volumes of mouldings are required, cold runner systems should be considered. These are justified by material savings over ￡10,000 pa. This process lends itself to relatively large quantities, a large number of cavities and infrequent changes of materials or moulds. Parts are repeatable and can be made to a high level of precision.</dd>

Compression moulding, for example, requires a "blank" of material in a size which will fill the cavity exactly.

Due to the nature of the injection process, material properties must be precisely measured and controlled to achieve the planned flow and cure behaviour, as well as the desired final characteristics of the rubber.</dd>

The cylinder can either be incorporated in the press or sometimes in the mould. Provision must be made for air to escape from the cavity as the rubber enters, and the feeding method chosen to suit the operational requirements of the part. This method of moulding can produce high-precision parts in moderate quantities without high tooling costs. In the simplest case, the mould can be the same as a compression mould with the addition of a feed hole. Maximum weights and number of cavities are governed by the capacity of the transfer cylinder and the clamp pressure.</dd>
